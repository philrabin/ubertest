# SF Food Truck Locations
========


Original Assignment
--------

[https://github.com/uber/coding-challenge-tools#food-trucks](Food Truck Challenge)


Features
--------

* backend is node.js
* front-end is single page Backbone app
* require.js used throughout for Handlebars, Models, Views, App, Async Google maps loading
* less for styles
* deployed on Heroko 
* bower.js for package management


Issues/If I had more time
--------

* would have liked an r.js build script for less and require but ran out time
* was starting on responsive design features but was more concerned with finishing something
* The api $where=within_box(...) query didn't seem to work so I ended up loaded all the locations up front and filtering in the app
